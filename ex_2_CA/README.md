# Binary Bomb Disassemble

This repository documents the steps I took to disassemble and defuse a binary bomb, a common reverse engineering task in many university computer science courses.

## Overview

The objective of this task is to apply reverse engineering techniques to analyze a binary bomb, understand its functionality, and defuse it. This task enhances skills in low-level programming, debugging, and binary analysis.
